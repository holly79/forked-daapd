ExecStart=@sbindir@/forked-daapd -f

# Constrain the upper limit of memory/swap that can be used; this prevents 
# forked-daapd from consuming all system memory (in event of bug/malformed user
# curl/SMARTPL query etc) that would hang/freeze low resource and headless (ie 
# RPi) machines
#
# systemd will kill the process in such an event but would be auto-restarted as
# per 'Restart' directive below
#
# Values derived from obersvations on rpi3 under load - limits are >50% above
# seen high watermarks
